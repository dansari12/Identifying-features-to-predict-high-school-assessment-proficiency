# Which feature can predict a high school's academic achievement?

The github repo contains all the data files, documentation and codes utilized in my Data Science Capstone Project.

**Project Goal**: Identify selected feature(s) that can predict a high schoolâ€™s academic achievement as measured by their proficiency performance on standardized state assessments for reading and math.

This project will contain 3 Phases that will provide the data, documentation and python codes utilized to complete this project.

Phase 1: Download, clean and process dataset
* Documentation folder: contains file spec, source information and other documentation related to the raw data files.
* Data folder
** Raw data files from each of the different repositories are stored within the Data folder
** Data files from each repository is cleaned, transformations are applied and then combined to create a Clean-[Repo name]-data file
** Each Clean-[Repo name]-data file is then combined once again to create a master dataset for reading and math. This file will be used for further analysis
* Notebook folder: Contains .ipynb files that contains code for cleaning and processing the raw data files and for merging files into master datasets.
* Code folder: Contains .py files that contains code for cleaning and processing the raw data files and for merging files into master datasets.

Phase 2: EDA and Model construction
* Data exploration and pattern identification
* Train and test regression models
* Notebook folder: Contains .ipynb files that contains code for EDA and data modelling of the master datasets.
* Code folder: Contains .py files that contains code for EDA and data modelling of the master datasets.

Phase 3: Execution and Interpretation
* Assess model performance using RMS

Operating System Requirements:
Windows 10 or above
Intel core processor with 2.5Ghz and 8 GB of RAM
