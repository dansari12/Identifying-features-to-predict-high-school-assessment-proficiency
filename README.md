# Predicting a high school’s proficiency on state assessments

The github repo contains all the data files, documentation and codes utilized in my Capstone Project for the Data Science graduate program at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

The purpose of this project is to help education policy makers utilize this information to identify at-risk schools at an early stage and thereby implement targeted interventions, funding or resources towards such schools to help improve their educational outcomes in the future.

**Project Goal**: Determine if selected school-level feature(s) can predict a high school’s academic achievement as measured by their proficiency performance on standardized state assessments for reading and math.

This project contained 3 Phases and this repo will provide information on the data, documentation and python codes utilized to complete this project.

## Phase 1: Download, clean and process dataset
* Documentation folder: contains file spec, source information and other documentation related to the raw data files.
* Data folder: Raw data files from each of the different repositories are stored within the Data folder. Data files from each repository is cleaned, transformations are applied and then combined to create a Clean-[Repo name]-data file. Each Clean-[Repo name]-data file is then combined once again to create a master dataset for reading and math. This file will be used for further analysis
* Notebook folder: Contains .ipynb files that contains code for cleaning and processing the raw data files and for merging files into master datasets.
* Code folder: Contains .py files that contains code for cleaning and processing the raw data files and for merging files into master datasets.

## Phase 2: EDA, Initial Model construction and Execution
* Data exploration and pattern identification
* Train and test initial regression models
* Assess model's performance using RMSE and Rsquared
* Notebook folder: Contains .ipynb files that contains code for EDA and initial data modeling of the master datasets.
* Code folder: Contains .py files that contains code for EDA and initial data modeling of the master datasets.

## Phase 3: Revised Modeling approach, Execution and Interpretation
* Train and test classification models
* Assess model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores
* Notebook folder: Contains .ipynb files that contains code for revised data modeling strategy of the master datasets.
* Code folder: Contains .py files that contains code for EDA and data modeling strategy of the master datasets.

## Operating System Requirements:
