# Which feature can predict a high school's academic achievement?

The github repo contains all the data files, documentation and codes utilized in my Data Science Capstone Project.

**Project Goal**: Identify selected feature(s) that can predict a high schoolâ€™s academic achievement as measured by their proficiency performance on standardized state assessments for reading and math. 

This project will contain 3 Phases that will provide the data, documentation and python codes utilized to complete this project.

Phase 1: Download, clean and process dataset
* Raw data files from each of the different repositories are stored within the Data folder
* Data files from each repository is cleaned, transformations are applied and then combined to create a Clean-[Repo name]-data file
* Each Clean-[Repo name]-data file is then combined once again to create a master dataset for reading and math. This file will be used for further analysis

Phase 2: EDA and Model construction
* Data exploration and pattern identification
* Train and test prediction models

Phase 3: Execution and Interpretation
* Assess model performance using RMS
