# Details about the Notebooks for Phase 2
* There are 2 python notebooks corresponding to EDA and Regression Modeling utilized on the Master data files for reading and math.

#### Math_data_EDA_Regression_Modeling.ipynb: This notebook contains code that explores the Master_math.csv for any correlations between the target and feature variables. Also, several regression models, such as Linear, Random Forest, SVR and KNN were utilized to predict the target variable (i.e. High school's proficiency in math). Various key metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different models.
