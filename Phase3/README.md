# Details about the Notebooks for Phase 3
* There are 2 python notebooks corresponding to EDA and CLassification Modeling utilized on the Master data files for reading and math.

#### Math_data_EDA_Classification_Modeling.ipynb: This notebook contains code that discretizes the target variable in the Master_math.csv into quantiles (1-Low, 2-Moderate, 3-High and 4-Very High). Also, several classification models, such as Logistic, Random Forrest, Gradient Boost, Extratrees, SVM and Knn were utilized to predict the target labels (i.e. 1-Low, 2-Moderate, 3-High and 4-Very High proficiency in math). Various key metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different models.
#### Reading_data_EDA_Classification_Modeling.ipynb: This notebook contains code that explores the Master_reading.csv into quantiles (1-Low, 2-Moderate, 3-High and 4-Very High). Also, several classification models, such as Logistic, Random Forrest, Gradient Boost, Extratrees, SVM and Knn were utilized to predict the target labels (i.e. 1-Low, 2-Moderate, 3-High and 4-Very High proficiency in math). Various key metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different models.
